	<p><strong>Pushpin color:</strong> The pushpin colors are configured using the RGB color scheme and a color selector is provided. By default, "0 0 0" (black) is selected. Shades of gray may be configured by typing variations of identically numbered triples. For example, "10 10 10" is dark gray whereas "100 100 100" is a lighter shade of gray.</p>

	<h2>Shaded Regions</h2>
	<p>Use the <em>Shaded Regions</em> tab to list political regions you would like shaded and select the shade color. Separate each political region by a comma or semicolon. Alternatively, you may use State/Province codes such as USA[WY|WA|MT], CAN[AB BC] that will shade Wyoming, Washington, Montana, Alberta, and British Columbia. Notice that States or Provinces are separated by a space or a pipe and these are wrapped with square brackets, prefixed with the three-letter ISO country code.</p>
