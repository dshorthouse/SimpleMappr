    <h2>Point Data</h2>
    <p>Use the <em>Point Data</em> tab to paste coordinates as <em>latitude, longitude</em> on separate lines and select the marker shape, size, and color.</p>
    
    <div>
    <p><strong>Coordinate format:</strong> <em>e.g.</em> in western hemisphere above equator 45.55, -120.25; in western hemisphere below equator -15.66, -65.10; eastern hemisphere above equator 64.82, 75.1</p>
    <p><img src="/images/help_data.png" alt="Example Data Entry" /></p>

    <p><strong>Pushpin color:</strong> The pushpin colors are configured using the RGB color scheme and a color selector is provided. By default, "0 0 0" (black) is selected. Shades of gray may be configured by typing variations of identically numbered triples. For example, "10 10 10" is dark gray whereas "100 100 100" is a lighter shade of gray.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Regions</h2>
    <p>Use the <em>Regions</em> tab to list political regions you would like shaded and select the shade color. Separate each political region by a comma or semicolon. Alternatively, you may use State/Province codes such as USA[WY|WA|MT], CAN[AB BC] that will shade Wyoming, Washington, Montana, Alberta, and British Columbia. Notice that States or Provinces are separated by a space or a pipe and these are wrapped with square brackets, prefixed with the three-letter ISO country code.</p>

    <h2>Freehand</h2>
    <p>Use the <em>Freehand</em> tab to record freehand drawing data represented as Well-known Text (WKT) and to adjust the color of the rendered line, circle, or polygon. A few examples are: POLYGON((-103 54,-111 51,-100 49,-103 54)) and  LINESTRING(-76 35,-76 35,-76 36,-76 36,-91 40)</p>
